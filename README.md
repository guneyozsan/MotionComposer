# Gameplay

Run the program and wait loading for caching the audio files.

Music starts automatically and help compose the song like a composer/DJ:

a - Change the orientation of the phone to shape music.

b - Shake the phone to move between random secions of the song, this way you can change the mood.

c - There isn't any GUI or button. Just think like it is a part of your body.

# Game Jam Theme

The theme of Global Game Jam 2012 (Ouroboros - Snake eats itself) led us to an infinitely going, self-sufficient music composing/listening game. With this game the listener can be a part of the music/composition while listening to it. There is no need for a GUI or buttons. The program and the music composition is designed so that the system is self-sufficient with the existence of its user and interface.

# Background

The game streams audio loops in five seperate channels (drums, bass, percussion, synths 1, synths 2). Different effects are applied to each channel according to the orientation. We composed synth1 and synth2 channels to create interesting and related combinations. There are several sets of loops in different moods. When the phone is shaked the music switches to a different set of loops. By this way you can be a part of the composition while listening.
